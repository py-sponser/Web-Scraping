# Instagram Bot

Still working on adding more features.

Features:
- Ability to get a page and follow all of it followers (people that follow this page).
- Ability to send a message to all people you follow.

Python packages used:
- Selenium
- time

There will be requirements.txt file to install required packages > pip install -r requirements.txt

Other important requirements to be able to run the script: you have to download Firefox or Chrome driver, add the file to PATH

For linux:
- type this command > mv file /usr/bin

For windows:
- Get the path of the file
- self.driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path="path of the file"), you'll find this line in the init constructor of the class.
